This is a fork of [@EternalPhane](https://github.com/EternalPhane)'s [Minecraft texture pack of transparent armors](https://github.com/EternalPhane/transparent-armor-texture). His version only worked for Bedrock Edition, but with a couple of lines of code, and renaming of textures, I made it work for Java as well.

#Minecraft Bedrock Edition:

This version only works on Minecraft Java Edition.

For those looking for a version of this Resource Pack that works with Bedrock Edition (aka Windows 10, console, iOS, Android, etc), check out [@EternalPhane](https://github.com/EternalPhane)'s original repo [here](https://github.com/EternalPhane/transparent-armor-texture).
